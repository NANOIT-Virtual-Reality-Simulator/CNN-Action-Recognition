# Action Recognition with CNN
Trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify images and videos using Pytorch. 

# Dataset
Used UCF101 data (see http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php) but took only 10 classes of all these classes. Each clip has 3 frames and each frame is 64 âˆ— 64 pixels. The label of clips are in q3 2 data.mat. trLb are labels for training clips and valLb are labels for validation clips.
